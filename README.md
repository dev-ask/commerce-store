# Commerce JS powered online store

I have built this small project to sell items online. Project is still not fully ready for deployment, but all fundamentals to an online store are working properly.

# Features added so far: 

- Browsing available listed items on the store
- Adding items to the cart
- Adjusting item quantity 
- Calculating shipping based on customer location
- Successfully making payment using card
- Sending customer a receipt and tracking number
